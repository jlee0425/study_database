### Aggregate data

(https://www.edglossary.org/aggregate-data/)

: numerical or non-numerical information that is (1) collected from multiple sources and/or on multiple measures, variables, or individuals and (2) compiled into data summaries or summarhy reports, typically for the purposes of public reporting or statistical analysis.

- i.e., examnining trends, making comparisons, or revealing information and insights that would not be observable when data elements are viewed in isolation.

- e.g., information about whether individual students graduated from high school can be _aggregated_ into a single graduation rate for a graduating class or school, and annual school graduation rates, which can then be aggreated into graduation rates for districts, states, and countries.
